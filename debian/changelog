germinate (0.9) dapper; urgency=low

  * When processing the build tree, germinate is (correctly) careful not to
    promote packages from lesser seeds, since we still want to consider them
    (e.g.) part of ship even if they're build-dependencies of desktop.
    However, this sometimes caused us to select the wrong alternative from
    an or-ed build-dependency (e.g. redland Build-Depends:
    libmysqlclient15-dev | libmysqlclient12-dev | libmysqlclient10-dev and
    libmysqlclient15-dev was in the Ubuntu supported seed). To fix this,
    process the packages at that point anyway and just avoid promoting them.

germinate (0.8) dapper; urgency=low

  * When identifying extras, check for binaries built from multiple source
    packages and skip any superseded binaries.
  * Change default for --components to main and restricted, since the Ubuntu
    seeds rely on packages from restricted in order to germinate correctly.

germinate (0.7) dapper; urgency=low

  * Depend on python-apt (thanks, Jani Monoses).

germinate (0.6) dapper; urgency=low

  * Add regular expression support in seeds. Weaken architecture
    specification error checking in order to be able to use [...] in regular
    expressions more easily.
  * Add support for including all the binaries from a given source package
    (using "%source") in seeds.
  * Add germinate --cleanup option, to prevent caching of Packages and
    Sources files.
  * Add germinate --source-mirror option, to allow Packages and Sources
    files to be on different mirrors (e.g. Ubuntu ports architectures).

germinate (0.5) dapper; urgency=high

  * Stop accidentally including extra in the all and supported+build-depends
    outputs.

germinate (0.4) dapper; urgency=low

  * Don't attempt to satisfy versioned dependencies of .debs using virtual
    packages, as the packaging toolchain doesn't support that. (udpkg/anna
    do support this for .udebs, and the installer relies on that.)
  * Change default distribution to dapper.

 -- Colin Watson <cjwatson@ubuntu.com>  Tue, 25 Oct 2005 12:14:07 +0100

germinate (0.3) breezy; urgency=low

  * Add a man page for germinate.
  * Explain in pkg-diff --help that you can supply a list of seeds to
    compare against as non-option arguments.
  * Update pkg-diff's default seeds to 'minimal standard desktop', to match
    the breezy seeds.
  * Add germinate --seed-packages option, to allow calculating dependencies
    of individual extra packages during a germinate run.
  * Policy version 3.6.2. No changes required.
  * Update GPL notices with the FSF's new address.

 -- Colin Watson <cjwatson@ubuntu.com>  Wed, 31 Aug 2005 18:47:20 +0100

germinate (0.2) breezy; urgency=low

  * Fix formatting of output lines with UTF-8 maintainer strings.
  * Really pick the first reason from the build-dependency tree to display
    in output files.
  * Record allowed d-i kernel versions on a per-seed basis, so that we can
    have some kernel versions supported for netboot installations only.
  * Force a trailing slash onto the end of any --seed-source argument.

germinate (0.1) breezy; urgency=low

  * Initial release.
