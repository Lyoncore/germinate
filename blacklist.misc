# Packages which are pulled in incidentally (typically by build-dependencies)

# java-common build-depends
#dpsyco
# various build-depends, pulls in lua, consider standarizing html->text
#elinks
# could be removed by getting rid of CHILL, which nothing uses
gcc-2.95
# tcl8.3 and tcl8.4 is more than enough, consider dropping tcl8.3 too
tcl8.0
# no one actually uses this anymore
#zephyr
